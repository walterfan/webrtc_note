Target readers
=====================
Front-end or back-end engineers who is interested in webrtc technology,


Features
=====================
* Each knowledge point has a corresponding example
* Start with theory and end with practice
* Extracted some commonly used methods and patterns in the industry

Problems to be solved
==============================
* The WebRTC technology stack is both deep and broad. In order not to get lost , a learning path is needed.
* The client-side standards are relatively substantial, while the server-side standards are relatively poor.
* There is a lack of some standard or easy-to-use models and methods, we need to reduce the learning curve and entry threshold
* There are some valuable new technologies that have not yet been promoted and need to be explored

Highlight
==============
* WebRTC gets started quickly from shallow to deep
* Combined with existing protocols and practices, some common patterns and best practices are summarized
* An in-depth look at quality control techniques including congestion control, packet recovery, etc.
* Rich diagram, chart and examples
