Overview
=========================

RDP
-------------------------
Remote Desktop Protocol, or RDP, is a proprietary protocol that allows its users to graphically control a remote computer. 

RDP is usually intended for 1:1 usage, and many remote computers can share the resources of a main computer through different profiles. Being Microsoftâ€™s proprietary protocol, RDP  works only with Windows systems, although the client is available for nearly all operating systems such as Mac, Android, and Linux.  

VNC
-------------------------
Virtual Network Computing, or VNC, is a graphical desktop sharing system that lets its users remotely control a computer while the main user can interact and watch. It is pixel-based, which means it is more flexible than RDP. 

VNC is platform-independent, which means it can easily be used across Mac, Windows, Linux, Raspberry Pi, and other platforms to share a desktop across different computers, and there are no limits in using VNC applications to connect to different computers on different platforms.
